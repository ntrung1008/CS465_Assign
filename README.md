# CS465_Assign
# Week 1,2 : For exercise2.html, I chose placekitten.com to recreate
# Week 3 : For exercise3.html, I used inline-block to style. For exercise4.html, I used normal flow. For exercise5.html I used position. For exercise6 and 7, I used a combination of boostrap grid and regular style.
# Week 4 : For this week exercise, I don't use a separate file for script because all the scripts were pretty short
# Week 5 : Hardest one in my opinion, at first I was using script to send the information to the server but it didn't work, turn out the form element automatic send it every time i click the submit button
# Week 6: I chose Intro to typescript, Intro to React and Angular apps from the given options
